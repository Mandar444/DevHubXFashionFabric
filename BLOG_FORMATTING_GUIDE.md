# Blog Content Formatting Guide

This guide explains how to use the enhanced blog content editor to create rich, visually appealing blog posts with highlighted headers and embedded images.

Add prominent, styled headers within your article content to organize and emphasize important sections.

**How to use:**
- **Option 1 (Recommended):** Click the "Add Header" button in the formatting toolbar
  - Select text in the content area and click the button to convert it to a header
  - Or click the button to insert a new header template
  
- **Option 2 (Manual):** Type `## ` followed by your header text
  - Example: `## Introduction to Sustainable Fashion`

**Result:** Headers will appear with:
- Large, bold text (2xl-3xl size)
- Green bottom border
- Subtle green background gradient
- Extra spacing above and below

### 2. **Embedded Images**
Insert images directly within your article content to illustrate points, showcase products, or enhance visual appeal.

**How to use:**
- **Option 1 (Recommended):** Click the "Add Image" button in the formatting toolbar
  - Select an image file from your computer (max 5MB)
  - The image will be automatically uploaded and inserted at your cursor position
  - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP

  - Format: `![Image Description](image-url)`
  - Example: `![Beautiful silk fabric](https://example.com/fabric.jpg)`

**Result:** Images will appear:
- Full-width with 400px height
- Rounded corners with shadow

## Best Practices

### Content Structure
1. **Start with an introduction** - Set the context without a header
2. **Use headers to organize** - Break content into logical sections
3. **Add images strategically** - Place images where they add value
4. **Keep paragraphs concise** - Easier to read on all devices

### Headers
- Use headers for major sections only (not every paragraph)
- Keep header text concise and descriptive
- Maintain a logical hierarchy in your content

### Images
- Use high-quality images (but under 5MB)
- Provide descriptive alt text for accessibility
- Place images near related content
- Don't overload with too many images (2-4 per article is ideal)

### Formatting Tips
- Leave blank lines between paragraphs for better readability
- The formatting toolbar makes it easy - use the buttons!
- Preview your post before publishing to ensure it looks correct
- You can edit and update formatting anytime

## Troubleshooting

**Image not showing?**
- Check that the URL is correct and accessible
- Ensure image file is under 5MB
- Verify image format is supported (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)

**Header not formatting?**
- Make sure you have `## ` (two hash marks and a space) before the text
- Check there's no extra text before the `##` on the same line

**Formatting looks wrong?**
